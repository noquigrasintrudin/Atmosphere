# The atmosphere of Earth

The atmosphere of Earth is a layer of gas above the crust. It is not solid and thus it fades away with height. The line between Earth’s atmosphere and space is set at 100 km / 62 miles up. It is called the Kármán line. Technically, anyone, who goes above it is an “astronaut.”

The atmosphere by volume is about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% argon, and the rest an assortment of trace gases. Water vapor is also present, almost all of it below a height of about 8-15 km/ 4.9 – 9 mi.

This part of the atmosphere is the warmest at the bottom, creating convection in the air that in turn creates currents of rising air. They carry water, forming clouds, which in turn is why we have weather.

The ozone layer is situated at a height of 25 km / 15.5 mi on average. This is a molecule of oxygen that absorbs very well solar ultraviolet light. This type of light is dangerous to biological molecules thus the ozone layer is critical for our protection and survival.

The atmosphere of Earth can be divided into 6 major layers:

(1). Troposphere – The lowest starting at ground level and extending upward to about 10 km / 6.2 miles. Most of the weather occurs here and most clouds are present.

(2). Stratosphere – It extends from the top of the troposphere to about 50 km / 31 mi above the ground. This is where the ozone layer is present. Unlike the troposphere, it gets warmer upwards this means a lack of turbulence favorable to commercial jet plane rides.

(3). Mesosphere – It extends upward to a height of about 85 km / 53 miles above the planet. Most of the meteors burn up in the mesosphere and unlike the stratosphere, the temperature drops again with the top temperature reaching about -90 degrees Celsius / -130 degrees Fahrenheit. The air here is far too thin to breathe and the pressure is well below 1% of the pressure at sea level.

(4). Thermosphere – A layer with very rare air and high-energy X-rays and radiation from the Sun being present but absorbed by the thermosphere. This raises the temperatures considerably and most satellites orbit the Earth in this layer. The auroras, Northern and Southern Lights, occur in the thermosphere. The top of the thermosphere varies between 500-1.000 km / 311-621 mi above the ground.

(5). Exosphere – Considered the final frontier of Earth’s gaseous envelope. The air here is extremely thin and leaks into space. The top once again varies: 100.000-190.000 km / 62.000-120.000 mi above the surface of Earth. The latter value is about halfway to the Moon.

(6). Ionosphere – It is not a distinct layer as the previous ones. It is rather a series of regions in parts of the mesosphere and thermosphere where high-energy radiation from the Sun has knocked electrons loose from their parent atoms and molecules. The electrically charged atoms & molecules are called ions endowing this region with some special properties.

Magnetosphere
Earth’s outer core is made from liquid metal which conducts electricity. The liquid convects, and this motion generates magnetic fields. Earth’s rotation helps organize this motion into huge cylindrical roles that align with the Earth’s axis.

This generates a magnetic field similar to a bar magnet, with a magnetic north pole and south pole. This field surrounds the Earth and deflects most of the charged particles from the solar wind. Without this geomagnetic field, the solar wind would directly hit Earth’s atmosphere eroding the air away. 

Mars doesn’t have a strong magnetic field, and it is believed that because of this its atmosphere is mostly vanquished.

Some solar wind particles are trapped by Earth’s magnetic field and are channeled down into the atmosphere. There, they are slammed into air molecules about 150 km / 93.2 mi up. This energizes the molecules, which respond by emitting light in different colors. This glow is called aurora.

The auroras happen near the geomagnetic poles, far north and south. They form ribbons and sheets, depending on the shape of the magnetic field.

Analysis revealed that a magnetic reversal takes place once every 40.000 years on average. When it will happen, compass needles would likely point in many different directions for a few centuries while the switch is being made. After this, the south will become north and vice versa.
